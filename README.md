## Hi there 👋

I'm a Linux Sysadmin with a strong focus on monitoring, incident management, and infrastructure-related tasks.

Currently, I'm transitioning into Neural Network Development and actively training to become an ML Engineer. As part of this journey, I'm deepening my expertise in Python, focusing on libraries like NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, and PyTorch to build and optimize machine learning models.

I'm excited to expand my knowledge in AI and ML, working on real-world projects, and contributing to the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence.
